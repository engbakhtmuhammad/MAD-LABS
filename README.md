## Course Project

### Project Requirements
Students are required to develop a complete mobile application using Flutter by the end of this course. The project should demonstrate the following:

- **Reusable Widgets**: Ensure that your app is designed with reusable and modular widgets.
- **Well-Structured Code**: Use design patterns such as MVC, MVVM, or others as per your project requirements.
- **State Management**: Implement proper state management (e.g., Provider, GetX, or Riverpod).
- **Backend Integration**: Use Firebase, REST APIs, or another backend of your choice.
- **Features**:
  - Complex layouts and navigation
  - Animations and transitions
  - Authentication (if applicable)
  - Integration of external packages and services

### Design Tools and Mockups
Use **Photopea** and the provided template files to create mockups for your project. Mockups should include:

1. A screenshot of the app’s UI designed in the mockup template.
2. A brief explanation of your app’s design and flow.

### Video Demo
Create a **video demonstration** of your app, showcasing all its features and functionality.

#### How to Include Mockup and Video
- Add the mockup image and video to this README file under the **Project Submission** section.
- The video can be hosted on YouTube or directly included as a link.
